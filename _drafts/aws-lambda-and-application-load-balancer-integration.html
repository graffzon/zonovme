<p>
				A few months ago I published a video, in which I expressed a воодушевление about the new AWS release of support Lambda functions as Target Groups for ALB (Application Load Balancer). In this article, I want to give you an overview, how to actually leverage this integration in building a website.</p>
<p>We will be using Terraform in order to build the infrastructure, if you're not fully familiar with this tool, I can recommend referring to this article: <a href="http://zonov.me/howto-create-an-aws-lambda-function-using-terraform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HOWTO: Create and integrate AWS Lambda function using Terraform</a>.</p>
