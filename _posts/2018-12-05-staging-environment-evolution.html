				Today, we will be talking about staging environment at Babbel and how we recently improved it. As a reader of this tech blog, there’s a good chance that you are already familiar with the concept of staging environment. I will nevertheless start with a brief definition so that we establish a common understanding before going into the details of how to secure a staging environment. Bear with me.</p>

<p>It is an interesting one, with good diagrams and sort of a storytelling, so enjoy :)		</p>
