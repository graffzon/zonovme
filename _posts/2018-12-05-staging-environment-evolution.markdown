Today, we'll dive into the enhancements we've recently implemented in the staging environment at Babbel. If you're an engineer, you're likely familiar with the concept of a staging environment. Nevertheless, I'll start with a concise definition to ensure we're all on the same page before exploring how to fortify a staging environment. Please stay with me.

Regrettably, the full content of this post is not included here. Originally crafted for Babbel's blog, I encourage you to explore the complete article at [Babbel's blog](https://bytes.babbel.com/en/articles/2018-11-21-Staging-environment-evolution.html).

It's a captivating read, featuring insightful diagrams and a narrative-like exposition. Enjoy! :)
