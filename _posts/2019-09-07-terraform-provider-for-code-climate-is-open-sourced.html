excerpt: "I contributed in a few open-source projects during my career, however, I'm particularly proud of this one."

<p>I have contributed to several open-source projects throughout my career, but there is one in particular that I hold
  in high regard.</p>
<p>This Terraform provider was developed during my work at Babbel, and we made the decision to open-source it.
  Impressively, it has been recognized and listed on the official Terraform community providers page.</p>
<p>For a comprehensive announcement and a detailed article discussing our motivations and the challenges we faced,
  please visit Babbel's blog: <a
