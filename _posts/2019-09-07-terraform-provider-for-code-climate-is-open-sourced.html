				I contributed in a few open-source projects during my career, however, I'm particularly proud of this one.</p>
<p>I've written this Terraform provider while working at Babbel, and we open-sourced it. Moreover, it got listed at the official Terraform community providers page.</p>
<p>The full announcement and the article about why we've done this and whether it was difficult, you can find at Babbel's blog: <a href="https://bytes.babbel.com/en/articles/2019-06-13-open-source-terraform-provider-for-codeclimate.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://bytes.babbel.com/en/articles/2019-06-13-open-source-terraform-provider-for-codeclimate.html</a>		</p>
